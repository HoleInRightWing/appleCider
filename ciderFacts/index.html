        <div class="info-paragraph">
            <p>
                Apple cider is a beverage that has been made for centuries, since as early as 55 BC! 
                In fact, early English settlers introduced cider to America by bringing apple seeds specifically for cider production.

                Now, you are in control of an apple orchard, with access to all sorts of apples, your job is to produce the best apple cider
                possible! The curators will be here to taste test when you are finished, so it is absolutely imperative for you to understand
                the basics of cider-making! This guide will show you the ropes of making cider, so read carefully!

        <h2>What Exactly is Apple Cider?</h2>
        <div class="info-paragraph">
            <p>
                It's important to make the distinction between apple cider and apple juice. Apple juice, as you should know, 
                is the liquid that is made by pressing and filtering the raw apples into a sweet, delicious beverage. Cider is made by fermenting
                apple juice, relying on the natural yeast that is present in apples to do the fermenting, turning the juice into a thicker drink 
                that can actually contain more of the healthy compounds found in apples than clear, commerical apple juice provides.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the United States, "cider" most often refers to non-alcoholic cider, also called "sweet cider". "Hard cider" refers to the 
                alcoholic version of the beverage. In other parts of the world, the terminology is different, so be careful! There are other terms 
                that are in use, too. As an example, dry cider is the same thing as hard cider.

                Choosing apples is the first step and is very important to making good cider.

                Be sure to use a blend of sweet and tart apple varieties to create the best cider. A bushel of apples (48 lbs) yields about 3 gallons of juice.

                Apples used for cider don't have to be pretty. But, they do have to be free from spoilage.
                Using blemished apples and small apples is perfectly okay, just be sure to cut out any 
                spoiled areas on otherwise good apples. If you don't cut these out, spoiled areas will cause 
                the juice to ferment too quickly and will ruin the cider. On a similar note, don't use apples that
                are browned, decayed, or moldy. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Apples should be firm and ripe. Green, underripe apples will cause the cider or juice to have a flat flavor.

                Sort and wash the apples, discard spoiled apples. Core and cut the apples into quarters or smaller. Use a filter and bottle to hold the apple juice.
            </p>

                Many household appliances can be used to juice apples. Apples should be cored and cut, then processed through a juice press, food chopper, blender, food 
                processor, knife, or a good ol' pair of fists. The crushed apple pulp should then be put into a clean muslin sack, then squeeze out the juice.
                And, voila, you have apple juice!

        <h2 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h2>
        <div class="info-paragraph">
            <p>
                The process of fermentation is what makes apple juice into apple cider. If sweet, clear, non-alcoholic cider is what you want, then the bottled juice should 
                be let to stand at 72 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 to 4 days. Be sure to use clearn cotton plugs instead of a regular lid or cap. If pressure builds up during 
                fermentation, the cotton will pop out and release the pressure. If a cap is used instead, the bottle will explode.
            </p>
            <p class="display">

            </p>
            <p>
                If dry cider is what you want, with more 'zip' or 'bite' to it, the cider should be fermented for longer at room temperature. After about 10 days, the cider will 
                look quite frothy and may foam over the top. It will continue to foam until fermentation is complete. Fermentation turns all the sugars in 
                the cider into alcohol. This cider is no longer a sweet drink, but rather a dry, hard, alcoholic cider.

        <div class="info-paragraph">
            <p>
                Fermentation should be stored indoors and at a regulated room temperature. Be aware, the worse quality the apples, the worse the sanitatiion and quality the cider will have over time!
            </p>

                Be sure not to ferment apple cider for too long. The taste of the cider will improve over time, but the healthiness of the cider will also decrease over a long period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to turn apple cider into vinegar, simply ferment the cider past the stages of sweet cider and dry cider. It will take approximately 4 to 6 months to turn the cider into vinegar.

        <h2 id="pasteurization">Pasteurization</h2>
        <div class="info-paragraph">
            <p>
                Pasteurization is absolutely crucial to creating a healthy drink. Unpasteurized, or fresh cider may contain baceria that case illness. These bacteria include E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella. 
                Regardless of if you have juice or cider, harmful bacteria must be killed by a pasteurization process prior to drinking.
            </p>
            <p class="display">
                <img src="../images/guide images/pasteurization.jpg" alt="" style="height: 475px; object-fit: cover; padding: 2em;">
            </p>
            <p>To pasteurize, cider or juice should be heated to at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit. It should be heated to 185 degrees at most to preserve the taste. It will taste less "cooked" if it is not boiled. 
                Skim off the foam that may develop and pour out the hot cider into clean containers. Refrigerate immediately.
